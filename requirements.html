                    <p>In the UK, more children die of preventable illnesses than elsewhere in Europe and this is due to the lack of information about these illnesses. Currently information about the diseases are available to everyone but the information is too complex to be understood by any non-medical person. To make the information more readable and easier to understand we created a website called iPoorly which shows information about acute illnesses for kids aged 0 to 5 in a simple, easy to understand and interactive way. Acute illnesses (diseases that develop quickly and last for a short period of time) are easy to detect and are also preventable, but if left unnoticed can have serious consequences.</p>
                    <p>Our project client is the Acutely Sick Kid Safety Netting for Families (ASK SNIFF) research team. ASK SNIFF is a collaboration between parents & carers, higher education institutions, NHS Trusts and the charity or third sector in the UK. Our client point of contact is Associate Professor Sarah Neill, a nurse academic and researcher with over 20 years experience in higher education from the University of Northampton. The team has a wealth of parental, academic and clinical expertise relating to assessment and management of the acutely sick child. The team has underwent numerous key stages to study and develop the final written content. The stages in which the team progressed through is visualised in the diagram below.</p>
                    <figure><img src="img/requirements-1.png" class="center-block"><figcaption class="text-center">Fig 1.1 - Project Stages</figcaption></figure>
                    <p>iPoorly is under the ASK SNIFF stage. The information for this website will come from the findings and researches of the previous stages. The information is based on national clinical guidelines and has been reviewed by parents and health care professionals.</p>

                    <h1 id="project-goals">Project Goals</h1>
                    <p>To create a informative and interactive website for parents and carers to use. The website will contain information about acute symptoms in the form of text, videos and images to help parents and carers spot those symptoms in their child. The website will also provide different information based on different age groups . The website will allow editors to add new content or update existing content. Parents and carers can create accounts in the website to store details about their children so that the information they see is based on the child's age. Users with an account can keep a diary for each of their child. These diaries will contain information about a child symptoms to help the user share with a medical professional. The website also allows users to skip creating an account if they only wish to visit the website once or want to see the website before they create an account. One goal is to allow parents and carer to quickly find information about a symptom.</p>
                    <p>The ASK SNIFF team have developed the written content for a website and associate mobile phone app. This content is based on national clinical guidelines and has been reviewed by parents and health professionals. The problem that the team faces now is the need to develop a prototype. The purpose of the web-app prototype is to provide parents of young children with video supported information resources to help families understand signs and symptoms of acute illness so that they can spot when their child is sick. These resources are also intended to support communication between families and health professionals.</p>
